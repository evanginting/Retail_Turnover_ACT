This repository include my work on forecasting project related to retail turnover in ACT, Australia. This project served as my effort to fulfill assignment from "Applied Forecasting" subject on my Master's Degree journey.

To see the report, please refer to the html file ("Retail_Project_33477558.html"). The forecast model utilised ARIMA and ETS Approach, which produce low RMSE score. The model were able to follow turnover pattern overtime mostly, resulting in good forecasted figure.
